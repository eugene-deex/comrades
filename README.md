## Plot

You're a female person that landed in a pod near Strogg's logistic center and correctional facility (jail). The path of Comrades' protagonist is not about to destroy the whole Stroggos race and kill the top Boss in the final. The protagonist is not a superhero.  

Most of the human forces are defeated, the survivors are trying to escape from the planet (including us). The best we can do - is to release as much as possible of our comrades in arms from Strogg's jails and catacombs. All we have - is a damaged voice transmitter that allows us to communicate with the unknown guy from a human's spaceship that floats on Stroggos orbit - the last piece of a chance to escape from that hell, full of convulsing flesh and bloody bioimplants.

In the middle of the way contact with our unknown supporter is mystically interrupted. Moreover, his pieces of advice lead us to tragic consequences that provoked multiply deaths of our comrades.

Was he our friend? Was he a human? Or maybe Strogg's progressive technologies already got so deep into human's minds so we can differentiate humans from Stroggs anymore? 

Will we save our comrades' lives? Will we find a way out from that accursed planet at all?

The answer is not predetermined. Everything depends only on you, comrade!

## How to run:

You can run maps in 2 methods: by executing .bat/.sh files (that launch quake with parameter "+map MAPNAME") or open in-game console with tilda (~) and type command "map MAPNAME" (without quotes).

Pay attention, MAPNAME should not has .bsp extension in the ending. 
Example:  map cmr_station4
Check .bat/.sh files content to know the appropriate level name.
